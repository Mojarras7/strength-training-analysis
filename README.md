# Strength Progression & Autoregulation Modeling
## Project Overview
This repository contains a data analysis and predictive modeling project focused on mechanical performance and autoregulation in resistance training. Using 4 months of raw, self-tracked data from a 4-day Upper/Lower split, this project transforms unstructured logs into a clean dataset to analyze the relationship between objective lifting metrics (e.g., tonnage, estimated 1RM) and subjective recovery factors (e.g., sleep, stress, energy levels).

## Core Objectives
1. **Data Engineering (ETL):** Build a robust pipeline in Python to extract, clean, and structure raw multi-format CSV files into a standardized tabular format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Quantify the statistical correlation between lifestyle/fatigue indicators and daily strength output.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop machine learning models to forecast suboptimal performance sessions and optimize fatigue management.
